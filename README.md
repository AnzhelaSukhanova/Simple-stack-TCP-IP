# Simple TCP/IP stack 
The implementation of a simple TCP/IP stack in an userspace on TAP with support for ARP, IP and ICMP.  

Try `make arp` or `make icmp` to see how the userspace networking stack responds to ARP requests or ICMP echo requests respectively.  
To delete the created tap-interface use `make del`.
